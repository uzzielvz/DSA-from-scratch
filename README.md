# Data Structures & Algorithms - FAANG Interview Prep

This repository contains from-scratch implementations of data structures and LeetCode problem solutions in Java. The goal is to prepare for FAANG interviews (target: July-August 2026 internship).

## 🎯 Goal

**Target:** FAANG internship for July-August 2026  
**Commitment:** 200-250 LeetCode problems in ~270 days  
**Current Progress:** 35 / 250 problems  
**Started Tracking:** October 31, 2025

## 📊 Quick Stats

- **Total Problems:** 35
- **Current Streak:** 2 days (Nov 12-13)
- **Patterns Covered:** Arrays, Hash Tables, Two Pointers, Binary Search, Stacks/Queues
- **Critical Gaps:** Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Linked Lists

## 🚀 Current Focus

**Week 2 (Nov 7-13):** Binary Search mastery complete + transition  
**Progress:** 9 Binary Search problems (MASTERY COMPLETE ✅)  
**Next Up:** Start Trees (this week), deep analysis of each problem from tomorrow

## 📚 Documentation

Each problem solution includes:
- Problem number and title
- Difficulty level
- Design pattern used
- Detailed solution approach
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Well-commented code

### Example:
```java
/**
 * Solution class for LeetCode Problem #704: Binary Search
 * Problem Number: 704
 * Difficulty: Easy
 * Design Pattern: Binary Search (Two Pointers)
 * Time complexity: O(log n)
 * Space complexity: O(1)
 */
```

## 📈 Tracking Files
