- **Must re-solve tomorrow to validate understanding**

---

#### Tuesday, Nov 4 (COMPLETED)
**Time:** ~10 minutes (validation only)  
**Focus:** Validation of #278

**Done:**
- [x] Re-solved #278 independently (8 min, correct on first try)

**Result:** Validation successful. Proved Monday's learning stuck.

---

#### Wednesday, Nov 5 (LOW QUALITY)
**Time:** Minimal  
**Status:** ⚠️ Low engagement, mostly review

**Reality:** Minimal practice, low quality day.

---

#### Thursday, Nov 6 (FAILED)
**Time:** None  
**Status:** ❌ No practice

**Streak broken.** 5 days → 0

---

#### Friday, Nov 7 (COMPLETED - STRONG RECOVERY)
**Time:** ~1.5 hours  
**Focus:** Binary Search (double search pattern)

**Done:**
- [x] Re-validated #278 (quick confirmation)
- [x] #34 - Find First and Last Position (Medium) - ~60 min

**Result:** Excellent recovery session. Tackled challenging Medium with guidance but implemented independently. Learned double binary search pattern.

---

#### Wednesday, Nov 5 (PLANNED)
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Focus:** Binary Search wrap-up or START TREES 🌲

**Option A: If Binary Search feels solid**
- [ ] Start Trees pattern
- [ ] First tree problem: #104 - Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (Easy)
- [ ] Read: Tree traversal basics (DFS/BFS)

**Option B: If need more Binary Search**
- [ ] 1-2 more Binary Search problems
- [ ] Focus on weaker variations

---

#### Thursday, Nov 6 (PLANNED)
**Time:** 1 hour  
**Focus:** Trees or Binary Search final problems

**Target:**
- [ ] If started Trees: continue with 1-2 more tree problems
- [ ] If Binary Search: wrap up pattern mastery
- [ ] Weekly review and planning

---

### Week 1 Success Criteria

**Must Complete:**
- ⚠️ 8-10 Binary Search problems total (6/10 - need 2-4 more)
- ✅ At least 2 Medium problems attempted (completed 2)
- ❌ 6 out of 7 practice days (only 5 - failed Thu, low Wed)
- ✅ All solutions documented

**Stretch Goals:**
- ❌ Start Trees by Wed/Thu (not started)
- ⚠️ <15 min avg on Binary Search Easy (mostly achieved)
- ⚠️ <30 min on Binary Search Medium (need more practice)
- ❌ Perfect 7/7 practice days (failed Thu)

**Reality Check:**
- Strong technical progress (2 Mediums solved)
- Consistency issues (mid-week break)
- Need to rebuild daily habit

---

## Week 2 Preview: Nov 7 - Nov 13, 2025

### Tentative Plan

**Primary Focus:** Trees (DFS/BFS fundamentals)  
**Secondary:** Continue mixed Binary Search practice

**Target:**
- 10-12 Tree problems (mix Easy/Medium)
- Patterns: Tree traversal, DFS, BFS, level-order
- Goal: Comfortable with tree recursion

**Key Problems to Cover:**
- Tree traversal (preorder, inorder, postorder)
- Maximum/Minimum depth
- Symmetric tree
- Path sum problems
- Level order traversal (BFS)

---

## Week 3-4 Preview: Nov 14 - Nov 27, 2025

---

## Phase 1 Roadmap (Months 1-3)

### Month 1: November 2025
- **Weeks 1-2:** Binary Search
- **Weeks 3-4:** Trees fundamentals

### Month 2: December 2025
- **Weeks 5-6:** Trees (advanced) + Graphs (intro)
- **Weeks 7-8:** Linked Lists + Stacks/Queues

### Month 3: January 2026
- **Weeks 9-10:** Recursion & Backtracking
- **Weeks 11-12:** Dynamic Programming (intro)

**Target by End of Phase 1:** 120-140 problems

---

## Adjustment Protocol

**If ahead of schedule:**
- Increase difficulty (more Medium problems)
- Explore advanced variations
- Start next pattern early

**If behind schedule:**
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Stick to fundamentals
- Extend pattern by 2-3 days
- Do NOT skip patterns

**If consistency breaks (miss 2+ days):**
- Emergency protocol: 10-min review session
- Restart with easiest problem in current pattern
- Reassess weekly goals
- Address underlying issues

---

## Resources for Week 1

**Binary Search:**
- NeetCode: Binary Search section
- LeetCode: Binary Search topic tag
- Template to memorize:
```java
int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
while (left <= right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
    else if (nums[mid] > target) right = mid - 1;
    else return mid;
}
return left; // or -1, depending on problem
```

**Upcoming (Trees):**
- Review: Tree traversal types
- Recursion fundamentals
- DFS vs BFS
