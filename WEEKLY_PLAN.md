## Phase 1 Roadmap (Months 1-3)

### Month 1: November 2025
- **Weeks 1-2:** Binary Search
- **Weeks 3-4:** Trees fundamentals

### Month 2: December 2025
- **Weeks 5-6:** Trees (advanced) + Graphs (intro)
- **Weeks 7-8:** Linked Lists + Stacks/Queues

### Month 3: January 2026
- **Weeks 9-10:** Recursion & Backtracking
- **Weeks 11-12:** Dynamic Programming (intro)

**Target by End of Phase 1:** 120-140 problems

---

## Adjustment Protocol

**If ahead of schedule:**
- Increase difficulty (more Medium problems)
- Explore advanced variations
- Start next pattern early

**If behind schedule:**
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Stick to fundamentals
- Extend pattern by 2-3 days
- Do NOT skip patterns

**If consistency breaks (miss 2+ days):**
- Emergency protocol: 10-min review session
- Restart with easiest problem in current pattern
- Reassess weekly goals
- Address underlying issues

---

## Resources for Week 1

**Binary Search:**
- NeetCode: Binary Search section
- LeetCode: Binary Search topic tag
- Template to memorize:
```java
int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
while (left <= right) {
    int mid = (left + right) / 2;
    if (nums[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
    else if (nums[mid] > target) right = mid - 1;
    else return mid;
}
return left; // or -1, depending on problem
```

**Upcoming (Trees):**
- Review: Tree traversal types
- Recursion fundamentals
- DFS vs BFS
