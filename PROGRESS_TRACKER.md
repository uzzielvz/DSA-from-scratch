## Problem Log

### Week 1: Oct 31 - Nov 6, 2025

#### Friday, October 31, 2025
**Session Time:** ~1 hour  
**Pattern Focus:** Binary Search (NEW)

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Pattern | Time | Status | Notes |
|---|---------|------------|---------|------|--------|-------|
| 704 | Binary Search | Easy | Binary Search | ~30 min | ✅ Solved | First Binary Search problem. Bug: loop condition (left < right → left <= right). Understood why left <= right is correct. |
| 35 | Search Insert Position | Easy | Binary Search | ~12 min | ✅ Solved | Applied same template. Key insight: return left when not found. Faster than first problem (pattern recognition working). |

**Key Learnings:**
- Binary Search template: `while(left <= right)` is crucial
- When loop terminates: `left > right` (not equal)
- `left` indicates insertion position when target not found
- Mid calculation: `mid = (left + right) / 2`

**Wins:**
- Debugged loop condition independently
- Second problem solved faster (30 min → 12 min)
- Correct complexity analysis for both

**Areas to Improve:**
- Initial confusion about when loop terminates
- Need more Binary Search variations to solidify

- **Graphs** - 0 problems (URGENT)
- **Dynamic Programming** - 0 problems (URGENT)
- **Linked Lists** - 0 problems
- **Recursion/Backtracking** - 0 problems

### 📊 Intermediate Understanding
- Stacks/Queues - 1 problem (need more)
- Sorting algorithms - basic understanding
- Bit Manipulation - 1 problem

## Critical Gaps Analysis

### 🚨 URGENT (Must address in next 2-3 weeks)
1. **Trees (0/10)** - Fundamental for FAANG
   - Start with: Easy tree traversals
   - Goal: 10-12 tree problems by Week 4
   
2. **Linked Lists (0/10)** - Common in interviews
   - Fast/Slow pointer pattern
   - Goal: 8-10 problems by Week 4

3. **Binary Search Depth** - Only 2 problems
   - Need 6-8 more for pattern mastery
   - Goal: Complete by Week 2

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT (Address in 4-6 weeks)
1. **Graphs (0/10)** - Critical for Amazon/Meta/Google
2. **Dynamic Programming (0/10)** - Required for Medium/Hard
3. **Recursion/Backtracking (0/10)** - Foundation for many patterns

### 📊 Monitor & Improve
1. Medium/Hard ratio - Currently 2/27 (7.4%)
   - Target: 40% Medium by Week 12
2. Speed on Medium problems
   - Track and improve over time

## Next Session Plan

**Date:** Saturday, November 1, 2025  
**Available Time:** 2 hours  
**Focus:** Binary Search (continue pattern mastery)

**Goals:**
- [ ] Solve 2-3 more Binary Search problems
- [ ] Progress: Easy → Medium transition
- [ ] Document all solutions

**Suggested Problems:**
1. #278 - First Bad Version (Easy) - Different context
2. #69 - Sqrt(x) (Easy) - Numeric binary search
3. #153 - Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (Medium) - Level up

## Coach Notes

### Strengths Observed:
- Mathematical thinking helps with algorithm analysis
- Fast learner - second problem solved in 12 min vs 30 min
- Good at debugging independently
- Analyzes complexity correctly
- Asks good clarifying questions

### Areas for Development:
- Consistency (mentioned as personal challenge)
- Need to tackle uncomfortable patterns (Trees, Graphs)
- Transition to Medium difficulty
- Speed on first attempt (will improve with practice)

### Coaching Strategy:
